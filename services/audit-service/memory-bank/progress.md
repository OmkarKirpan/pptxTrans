## Known Issues

1. **Session Validation**: Test sessions bypass validation but production sessions require database access, which can fail if the database is unavailable.
2. **Memory Usage**: In-memory storage for test events could lead to memory pressure with extensive testing.
3. **Token Validation**: The service still requires JWT tokens for production requests, which could be a bottleneck.
