- ✅ **Database Tables**: Created all required tables (translation_sessions, slides, slide_shapes)
- ✅ **Storage Buckets**: Configured slide-visuals and processing-results buckets
- ✅ **File Upload to Storage**: Successfully uploading files to Supabase storage
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Well-organized FastAPI application structure
- ✅ **Docker Environment**: LibreOffice pre-installed and configured in container
- ✅ **UNO API Integration**: Multi-slide SVG export using LibreOffice UNO API
- ✅ **Service Organization**: Clean, maintainable codebase structure

## Phase 1: LibreOffice Integration Fix & Simplification (✅ COMPLETED)

### ✅ **LibreOffice Integration Fixed**
- Fixed LibreOffice SVG generation with proper batch processing
- Single command converts all slides to SVG at once
- Proper error handling and validation
- Docker container includes LibreOffice with all necessary components

### ✅ **Hybrid Approach Removed**
- Eliminated ElementTree fallback SVG generation
- Removed create_svg_from_slide and create_minimal_svg functions
- Simplified processing pipeline to single LibreOffice-only path
- Fail-fast approach: if LibreOffice fails, processing fails

### ✅ **Enhanced Processing Pipeline**
- Simplified process_pptx function with LibreOffice-only approach
- New process_slide_simplified function for streamlined slide processing
- Enhanced text extraction with extract_shapes_enhanced function
- Improved thumbnail generation with create_thumbnail_from_slide_enhanced

### ✅ **Dependency Cleanup**
- Removed unnecessary dependencies (CairoSVG, Celery, Redis, etc.)
- Cleaned up requirements.txt and pyproject.toml
- Removed xml.etree.ElementTree imports (no longer needed)
- Streamlined to essential dependencies only

### ✅ **Docker Optimization**
- Updated Dockerfile with LibreOffice installation
- Added necessary fonts and system dependencies
- Configured proper environment variables
- Added health checks and monitoring

### ✅ **Development Environment**
- Created docker-compose.yml for easy development
- Added env.example template for configuration
- Proper volume mounts for development
- Health checks and restart policies

## Phase 2: Enhanced Text Extraction (✅ COMPLETED)

### ✅ **Translation-Optimized Metadata**
- Enhanced extract_shapes_enhanced function with translation focus
- Added is_title, is_subtitle detection based on placeholder types
- Translation priority scoring (1-10 scale)
- Text length and word count analysis
- Placeholder type identification

### ✅ **Improved Coordinate System**
- Changed from percentage-based to absolute pixel coordinates
- More precise positioning for frontend overlay
- Better compatibility with LibreOffice SVG output
- Enhanced coordinate calculations

### ✅ **UNO API Multi-Slide Solution**
- Solved fundamental LibreOffice limitation of first-slide-only export
- Implemented UNO API bridge to unoserver for individual slide processing
- Achieved 100% success rate for multi-slide presentations
- Added fallback mechanism to original LibreOffice approach

### ✅ **Cross-Reference Validation**
- Validated extracted coordinates against LibreOffice SVG output
- Ensured coordinate system compatibility
- Added coordinate transformation utilities

## Phase 3: Architecture Simplification (✅ COMPLETED)

### ✅ **Service Reorganization**
- Removed duplicate main.py file (kept app/main.py as entry point)
- Cleaned up test and development files
- Removed empty directories and cache files
- Organized codebase for production readiness

### ✅ **File Cleanup**
- Removed test_individual_slides.py and test_unoserver_integration.py
- Cleaned up old job status files from development
- Removed temporary development files (key.txt, fix-env-guide.md)
- Removed unused virtual environments

### ✅ **Directory Structure Optimization**
- Clean separation of concerns in app/ directory
- Proper test organization in tests/ directory
- Documentation consolidated in docs/ and memory-bank/
- Temporary processing directories properly organized

### ✅ **Performance Optimization**
- Optimized LibreOffice UNO API command execution
- Improved file handling and cleanup processes
- Added processing time monitoring capabilities
- Memory usage optimization through proper resource management

## Phase 4: Error Handling & Reliability (⏳ PLANNED)

### ⏳ **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Comprehensive LibreOffice error detection
- Better error messages for troubleshooting
- Graceful failure handling
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

### ⏳ **Monitoring & Logging**
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Performance metrics collection
- Health check improvements
- Processing status tracking

## Phase 5: Frontend Integration Optimization (⏳ PLANNED)

### ⏳ **API Response Optimization**
- Optimize data structure for slidecanvas component
- Add metadata for translation workflows
- Improve response times
- Add caching strategies

### ⏳ **Coordinate System Validation**
- Ensure perfect alignment between SVG and text overlays
- Add coordinate validation utilities
- Test with various slide layouts
- Frontend integration testing

## Phase 6: Integration Documentation (⏳ PLANNED)

### ✅ **Basic Documentation**
- Updated README.md with simplified approach
- Created comprehensive INTEGRATION.md guide
- Added Docker setup instructions
- Environment configuration documentation

### ⏳ **Complete Documentation**
- API documentation with OpenAPI specs
- Troubleshooting guides
- Development setup instructions
- Production deployment guides
