## Phase 1: LibreOffice Integration Fix & Simplification (✅ COMPLETED)

### ✅ **LibreOffice Integration Fixed**
- Fixed LibreOffice SVG generation with proper batch processing
- Single command converts all slides to SVG at once
- Proper error handling and validation
- Docker container includes LibreOffice with all necessary components

### ✅ **Hybrid Approach Removed**
- Eliminated ElementTree fallback SVG generation
- Removed create_svg_from_slide and create_minimal_svg functions
- Simplified processing pipeline to single LibreOffice-only path
- Fail-fast approach: if LibreOffice fails, processing fails

### ✅ **Enhanced Processing Pipeline**
- Simplified process_pptx function with LibreOffice-only approach
- New process_slide_simplified function for streamlined slide processing
- Enhanced text extraction with extract_shapes_enhanced function
- Improved thumbnail generation with create_thumbnail_from_slide_enhanced

### ✅ **Dependency Cleanup**
- Removed unnecessary dependencies (CairoSVG, Celery, Redis, etc.)
- Cleaned up requirements.txt and pyproject.toml
- Removed xml.etree.ElementTree imports (no longer needed)
- Streamlined to essential dependencies only

### ✅ **Docker Optimization**
- Updated Dockerfile with LibreOffice installation
- Added necessary fonts and system dependencies
- Configured proper environment variables
- Added health checks and monitoring

### ✅ **Development Environment**
- Created docker-compose.yml for easy development
- Added env.example template for configuration
- Proper volume mounts for development
- Health checks and restart policies

## Phase 2: Enhanced Text Extraction (✅ COMPLETED)

### ✅ **Translation-Optimized Metadata**
- Enhanced extract_shapes_enhanced function with translation focus
- Added is_title, is_subtitle detection based on placeholder types
- Translation priority scoring (1-10 scale)
- Text length and word count analysis
- Placeholder type identification

### ✅ **Improved Coordinate System**
- Changed from percentage-based to absolute pixel coordinates
- More precise positioning for frontend overlay
- Better compatibility with LibreOffice SVG output
- Enhanced coordinate calculations

### ✅ **UNO API Multi-Slide Solution**: Solved fundamental LibreOffice limitation of first-slide-only export by implementing a dual-strategy SVG generation (`svg_generator.py`) that uses the UNO API as its primary approach and falls back to batch processing for reliability.

### ✅ **Cross-Reference Validation**
- Validated extracted coordinates against LibreOffice SVG output
- Ensured coordinate system compatibility
- Added coordinate transformation utilities

## Phase 3: Architecture Simplification (✅ COMPLETED)

### ✅ **Service Reorganization**
- Removed duplicate main.py file (kept app/main.py as entry point)
- Cleaned up test and development files
- Removed empty directories and cache files
- Organized codebase for production readiness

### ✅ **File Cleanup**
- Removed test_individual_slides.py and test_unoserver_integration.py
- Cleaned up old job status files from development
- Removed temporary development files (key.txt, fix-env-guide.md)
- Removed unused virtual environments

### ✅ **Directory Structure Optimization**
- Clean separation of concerns in app/ directory
- Proper test organization in tests/ directory
- Documentation consolidated in docs/ and memory-bank/
- Temporary processing directories properly organized

### ✅ **Performance Optimization**
- Optimized LibreOffice UNO API command execution
- Improved file handling and cleanup processes
- Added processing time monitoring capabilities
- Memory usage optimization through proper resource management

## Phase 4: Error Handling & Reliability (✅ COMPLETED)

### ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**:
- Implemented `async_retry` decorator with exponential backoff for `unoserver` connections, making SVG generation more resilient to transient network issues.
- Comprehensive LibreOffice error detection
- Better error messages for troubleshooting
- Graceful failure handling

### ✅ **Monitoring & Logging**
- Reconfigured logging to output structured JSON for easier parsing and monitoring.
- Enriched logs with contextual data (`job_id`, `session_id`, etc.).
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Performance metrics collection
- Health check improvements
- Processing status tracking

## Phase 5: Frontend Integration Optimization (✅ COMPLETED)
- Analyzed frontend `slides-slice.ts` and confirmed API payload is sufficient.
- No payload changes required at this time.

## Phase 6: Major Code Refactoring & Modularization (✅ COMPLETED)

### ✅ **Critical Issue Resolved**
- **Monolithic Architecture**: The 600+ line `pptx_processor.py` was becoming unmaintainable
- **Solution**: Successfully refactored into a suite of focused, single-responsibility services.
- **Result**: Clean separation of concerns with enhanced reliability and testability, creating a true service-oriented architecture.

### ✅ **SVG Generation Module (`svg_generator.py`)**
- **Responsibility**: All SVG generation logic.
- **Features**: Implements a dual-strategy approach using the UNO API as primary and batch conversion as a fallback. Includes async retry decorators for resilient connections.

### ✅ **Slide Parser Module (`slide_parser.py`)**
- **Responsibility**: All shape extraction, text processing, and coordinate validation logic.
- **Features**: Cell-level table processing, fuzzy text matching against generated SVGs, and translation-optimized metadata output.

### ✅ **Main Processor & Job Management (`pptx_processor.py`, `processing_manager.py`, `worker_pool.py`)**
- **Responsibility**: The `pptx_processor` orchestrates the workflow, while the `ProcessingManager` and `WorkerPool` manage a background job queue and control concurrency.

### ✅ **Data & State Management (`cache_service.py`, `job_status.py`, `results_service.py`, `supabase_service.py`)**
- **Responsibility**: A suite of services to handle caching, local real-time status, final result aggregation, and all communication with Supabase for persistent storage and status.

### ✅ **Refactoring Achievements**
- **Code Quality**: Reduced complexity, enhanced maintainability by moving from a monolith to a service-oriented architecture.
- **Testability**: Isolated services enable focused unit testing.
- **Reliability**: The new architecture with job queues, retries, and fallbacks is significantly more robust.
- **Feature Completeness**: All capabilities preserved and enhanced within a more scalable structure.

## Phase 11: Test Framework Analysis (✅ VERIFIED - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)

### ✅ **What's Actually Implemented (Verified 2024-12-27)**
- **Modern `conftest.py` Structure**: 
    - Session-scoped `test_settings` fixture with proper test configuration
    - Session-scoped `app` fixture with dependency overrides 
    - Module-scoped `test_client` fixture with ProcessingManager mocking
    - Properly structured `mock_supabase_client` and `mock_supabase_service` fixtures
- **Test Isolation**: Integration test uses `tmp_path` fixture correctly
- **Comprehensive Mocking**: All external dependencies properly mocked
- **Test Stability**: All 15 tests passing consistently

### ⚠️ **Areas Not Fully Modernized**
- **Mixed Fixture Usage**: Some tests still use custom fixtures (e.g., `test_core_processing.py` has its own `settings` fixture)
- **Direct Application Imports**: One test file still uses `from app.core.config import get_settings` instead of centralized fixtures
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Not all test files follow the same fixture patterns

### ✅ **Current Status**
- **Test Framework**: FUNCTIONAL BUT NOT FULLY MODERNIZED
- **Test Results**: 15 PASSED, 0 FAILED ✅ (All tests stable and working)
- **Production Impact**: None - tests are reliable and comprehensive

### ✅ **Docker Configuration Improvements**
