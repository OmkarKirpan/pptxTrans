# Memory Bank Synchronization Log

## Date: Current

### Latest Sync: Memory Bank Synchronization with Main App

**Direction**: Bi-directional sync between main app and PPTX processor service  
**Type**: Cross-service memory bank alignment  
**Scope**: Complete PPTX processor service status synchronization

#### Files Synced
- **Main App Memory Bank**:
  - `activeContext.md` - Updated PPTX processor section from Phase 2 to ALL PHASES COMPLETED
  - `progress.md` - Added comprehensive phase-by-phase achievements (Phases 6-11)
- **PPTX Processor Memory Bank**:
  - `activeContext.md` - Added synchronization context and main app achievements reference

#### Changes Made

**Main App Updates**:
- **PPTX Processor Service Status**: Updated to "ALL PHASES COMPLETED - PRODUCTION READY"
- **Phase 11 Details**: Test framework implementation status (15 PASSED, 0 FAILED)
- **Phase 10 Details**: Test case stabilization and comprehensive coverage
- **Phase 9 Details**: Runtime stability restoration and import error fixes
- **Phases 6-8 Details**: Service-oriented architecture, Docker deployment, documentation organization
- **Modular Components**: Complete breakdown of refactored service architecture
- **Production Ready Features**: Enhanced reliability, export functionality, comprehensive error handling

**PPTX Processor Updates**:
- **Synchronization Section**: Added context about memory bank sync with main app
- **Main App Achievements**: Referenced README overhaul, documentation organization, export integration
- **Cross-service Context**: Service achievements now contextualized within broader project

#### Synchronization Achievements

**Technical Accuracy**:
- ✅ All 11 development phases properly documented in main app memory bank
- ✅ Test framework status accurately reflected (functional but not fully modernized)
- ✅ Service-oriented architecture details synchronized
- ✅ Docker production configuration documented
- ✅ Export functionality integration maintained

**Documentation Consistency**:
- ✅ Both memory banks use consistent terminology and status indicators
- ✅ Production readiness clearly communicated across both contexts
- ✅ Cross-service awareness established for comprehensive project view
- ✅ Phase-by-phase achievements properly aligned

### Notes
- This sync ensures both memory banks accurately reflect the complete production-ready status of the PPTX processor service
- All improvements related to service-oriented architecture, Docker configuration, test framework, and export functionality are now synchronized
- Cross-service contextual awareness established for better project-wide understanding

## Date: Previous

### Sync Details
