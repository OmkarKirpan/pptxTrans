3. **Verify Data Flows**: Test PPTX processor with real Supabase data
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify end-to-end workflows actually work

#### **Short Term (Phase 2):**
1. **Export Verification**: Test export functionality with actual translated data
2. **Service Communication**: Verify inter-service communication works
3. **Complete Testing**: Ensure all services have reliable test suites

#### **Medium Term (Phase 3):**
1. **Production Readiness**: Only after all services are verified working
2. **Performance Testing**: Load testing and optimization
3. **Security Audit**: Comprehensive security review

### Sync Status
