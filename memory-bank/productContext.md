# Product Context: PowerPoint Translator App

## 1. Problem Solved
Translating PowerPoint presentations is often a cumbersome and manual process. Key challenges include:
- **Loss of Formatting:** Manually copying text into translation tools and back into PowerPoint can break complex layouts, fonts, and visual elements.
- **Inefficiency:** The process is time-consuming, especially for large presentations.
- **Collaboration Difficulties:** Reviewing and discussing translations within the presentation context is difficult with traditional methods.
