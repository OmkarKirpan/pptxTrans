# Active Context: PowerPoint Translator App

## 1. Current Work Focus
The primary focus is on implementing a full-stack solution for high-fidelity slide rendering and translation, with three main components:

1. **PPTX Processor Service:** A Python FastAPI microservice for server-side PPTX processing
   - Converting slides to SVGs using LibreOffice with ElementTree fallback
   - Extracting text elements and their coordinates
   - Storing processed data in Supabase
   - Maintaining robust job status tracking and error handling

2. **Audit Service:** A Go microservice for audit logging and history tracking
   - Providing read-only access to session audit logs
   - Supporting JWT and share token authentication
   - Implementing pagination and filtering for audit data
   - Ensuring secure access control based on user permissions

3. **Frontend Slide Editor:** Refining the slide rendering and text editing interface
   - Displaying SVG backgrounds with interactive HTML overlays for text editing
   - Implementing the complete data flow from upload to editing
   - Integrating with the Audit Service for activity tracking

## 2. Recent Changes & Accomplishments
- **PPTX Processor Service Implementation:**
  - Created a standalone Python FastAPI service with endpoints for PPTX processing
  - Implemented `/v1/process` endpoint for handling PPTX uploads and conversion
  - Added background task processing using FastAPI BackgroundTasks
  - Integrated LibreOffice for high-quality SVG conversion
  - Implemented ElementTree fallback for SVG generation when LibreOffice is unavailable
  - Added text extraction with coordinate data
  - Implemented job status tracking with file-based persistence
  - Added retry capability for failed jobs
  - Implemented Supabase integration for storage and database updates
  - Added health check endpoint for monitoring service status

- **Audit Service Implementation and Integration:**
  - Developed a Go-based microservice using Gin framework
  - Implemented secure JWT validation with caching for performance
  - Created endpoint for retrieving paginated session history
  - Added share token validation for reviewer access
  - Implemented comprehensive middleware stack (auth, logging, error handling)
  - Added Swagger documentation for API endpoints
  - Set up containerized deployment with Docker
  - Implemented structured logging with request ID tracking
  - Added comprehensive error handling and consistent error responses
  - Fixed API format compatibility issue by updating field names from 'action' to 'type' across the entire codebase
  - Enhanced error handling for service unavailability with specific error messages and graceful degradation
  - Updated documentation for test session ID pattern and environment configuration
  - **Frontend Integration:** (NEW)
    - Integrated the `useAuditLog` hook into the editor page for user actions
    - Enhanced `SlideCanvas` component to pass detailed shape data for better audit logging
    - Implemented audit logging for key user actions (viewing, editing, navigation)
    - Added error handling and offline support through the `AuditQueueService`

- **Database Schema:** Successfully defined and created `slides`, `slide_shapes`, `audit_logs`, and `session_shares` tables in Supabase, including RLS policies and `updated_at` triggers.

- **Type Definitions:** Updated TypeScript types (`ProcessedSlide`, `SlideShape`) to align with the new database schema and the data required for the high-fidelity rendering approach.

- **`SlideCanvas` Refactor:**
  - Modified `SlideCanvas` to expect a `ProcessedSlide` object
  - It now renders an SVG image (from `slide.svg_url`) as the background
  - It overlays interactive, transparent `div`s for text shapes based on coordinates stored in `SlideShape` objects
  - Click handlers on these overlays trigger a text editing dialog
  - Enhanced to provide detailed shape data to event handlers for audit logging purposes

- **User Profile & Settings Pages:**
  - Implemented complete user profile page with form validation and Supabase Auth integration
  - Added password change functionality with strength indicator and validation
  - Created comprehensive settings page with translation preferences, notifications, and application settings
  - Implemented theme system with dark/light/system support and live preview
  - Added proper navigation integration through dashboard header

## 3. Next Immediate Steps
1. **Resolve LibreOffice SVG Generation Issues on Windows:**
   - Debug the LibreOffice command-line arguments for better output
   - Test different LibreOffice versions or configurations
   - Consider alternative solutions if needed

2. **Connect Frontend to PPTX Processor Service:**
   - Update the `UploadWizard` to send uploaded PPTX files to the processor service
   - Implement polling mechanism to track processing status
   - Display processing progress to users

3. **Complete Audit Logging Integration in Frontend:**
   - Add audit logging for dashboard actions (sharing, export, deletion)
   - Implement audit logging for batch operations
   - Test the complete audit flow from frontend to backend

4. **Refine Slide Editor Data Flow:**
   - Update `SlideNavigator` to use actual SVGs from processed slides
   - Implement proper data fetching from Supabase in `editor/[sessionId]/page.tsx`
   - Enhance text editing dialog with additional features (font size, basic formatting)

5. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Setup proper deployment environment for both microservices
   - Configure integration between Next.js frontend and backend services
   - Implement proper service discovery and API gateway if needed

6. **Translation Session Management:**
   - Implement complete session lifecycle from creation to export
   - Add functionality to track translation progress
   - Integrate audit logging for session activities

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Architecture Choice:** The decision to use separate microservices for PPTX processing and audit logging is confirmed as the right approach. This provides better separation of concerns, scalability, and language-specific optimizations.

- **Processing Pipeline:** The current pipeline uses a hybrid approach:
  - Primary: Batch LibreOffice SVG generation for best visual fidelity
  - Fallback: ElementTree-based SVG generation when LibreOffice is unavailable
  - Text extraction using python-pptx is consistent across both approaches

- **Audit Service Language Choice:** Go was selected for the Audit Service due to its:
  - High performance for read-heavy workloads
  - Strong concurrency model for handling multiple requests
  - Type safety and memory efficiency
  - Excellent standard library for HTTP services

- **Authentication Strategy:** 
  - JWT tokens for normal user authentication
  - Share tokens for limited access (e.g., for reviewers)
  - Caching validated tokens to reduce validation overhead
  - Common authorization logic in both frontend and microservices

- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is crucial throughout all services:
  - Domain-specific error types in each service
  - Consistent error response formats
  - Detailed logging with request IDs for traceability
  - Graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms

- **Performance Considerations:** 
  - Monitor SVG rendering performance, especially for complex slides
  - Consider optimization techniques for presentations with many slides
  - Implement proper cleanup of temporary files in the processor service
  - Use connection pooling and caching in the Audit Service
  - Consider adding pagination controls to all list views

- **Deployment Strategy:**
  - Containerize all microservices for consistent deployment
  - Implement health checks and monitoring
  - Consider using Kubernetes for orchestration
  - Implement proper logging and metrics collection

- **UI Consistency:** The recently implemented profile and settings pages maintain consistent UI patterns with the rest of the application, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- **Feature Prioritization:** (NEW)
  - Focus on the core PPTX translation functionality first
  - Comments System will be implemented in a future phase
  - Prioritize audit logging for critical user actions (editing, exporting, sharing)
