## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Real-time Synchronization Strategy:**
  - Using Supabase real-time channels for efficient database change subscriptions
  - Implementing optimistic updates pattern for responsive UI feedback
  - Managing synchronization errors with proper recovery mechanisms
  - Balancing real-time updates with local persistence for offline support

- **Persistence Strategy:** 
  - Using localStorage for web persistence (survives browser restarts)
  - Implementing selective persistence with partialize to manage storage size
  - Storing only critical data needed for app functioning
  - Adding proper storage initialization and error handling

- **State Management Architecture:** The Zustand implementation provides:
  - Lightweight and performant state management without boilerplate
  - TypeScript-first approach with excellent type inference
  - Easy integration with React components via hooks
  - Modular slice-based architecture for maintainability
  - Built-in devtools support for debugging
  - Persistence capabilities for offline support (implemented)
  - Efficient state synchronization through custom middleware

- **Store Structure:** The modular slice approach allows:
  - Clear separation of concerns between different state domains
  - Easy testing of individual slices
  - Scalability as new features are added
  - Prevention of large, monolithic state objects
  - Selective subscriptions for performance optimization

- **Architecture Choice:** The decision to use separate microservices for PPTX processing and audit logging is confirmed as the right approach. This provides better separation of concerns, scalability, and language-specific optimizations.

- **Processing Pipeline:** The current pipeline uses a hybrid approach:
  - Primary: Batch LibreOffice SVG generation for best visual fidelity
  - Fallback: ElementTree-based SVG generation when LibreOffice is unavailable
  - Text extraction using python-pptx is consistent across both approaches

- **Audit Service Language Choice:** Go was selected for the Audit Service due to its:
  - High performance for read-heavy workloads
  - Strong concurrency model for handling multiple requests
  - Type safety and memory efficiency
  - Excellent standard library for HTTP services

- **Authentication Strategy:** 
  - JWT tokens for normal user authentication
  - Share tokens for limited access (e.g., for reviewers)
  - Caching validated tokens to reduce validation overhead
  - Common authorization logic in both frontend and microservices

- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is crucial throughout all services:
  - Domain-specific error types in each service
  - Consistent error response formats
  - Detailed logging with request IDs for traceability
  - Graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms
  - Store error states for UI feedback

- **Performance Considerations:** 
  - Monitor SVG rendering performance, especially for complex slides
  - Consider optimization techniques for presentations with many slides
  - Implement proper cleanup of temporary files in the processor service
  - Use connection pooling and caching in the Audit Service
  - Consider adding pagination controls to all list views
  - Zustand store should implement selective subscriptions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Monitor store size and serialization performance for persistence

- **Deployment Strategy:**
  - Containerize all microservices for consistent deployment
  - Implement health checks and monitoring
  - Consider using Kubernetes for orchestration
  - Implement proper logging and metrics collection

- **UI Consistency:** The recently implemented profile and settings pages maintain consistent UI patterns with the rest of the application, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- **Feature Prioritization:**
  - Focus on the core PPTX translation functionality first
  - Comments System will be implemented in a future phase (store structure is prepared)
  - Prioritize audit logging for critical user actions (editing, exporting, sharing)
  - Complete state management integration before adding new features
  - Add persistence and offline support as secondary priority
