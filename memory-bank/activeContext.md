  - Introduced `isProcessingSubmittedConfig` state in `upload-wizard.tsx` to disable the button throughout the entire session creation and PPTX processing flow.

- **Editor Integration & Refinement (COMPLETED):**
  - Refactored `app/editor/[sessionId]/page.tsx` to use Zustand store for all data management.
  - Removed mock slide data and direct Supabase calls for fetching slides.
  - Integrated `fetchSessionDetails(sessionId)` from `useTranslationSessions()` for session metadata.

  - Lightweight and performant state management without boilerplate
  - TypeScript-first approach with excellent type inference
  - Easy integration with React components via hooks
  - Modular slice-based architecture for maintainability
  - Built-in devtools support for debugging
  - Persistence capabilities for offline support (implemented)
  - Efficient state synchronization through custom middleware

- **Store Structure:** The modular slice approach allows:
  - Clear separation of concerns between different state domains
  - Easy testing of individual slices
  - Scalability as new features are added
  - Prevention of large, monolithic state objects
  - Selective subscriptions for performance optimization

- **Architecture Choice:** The decision to use separate microservices for PPTX processing and audit logging is confirmed as the right approach. This provides better separation of concerns, scalability, and language-specific optimizations.

- **Processing Pipeline:** The current pipeline uses a hybrid approach:
  - Primary: Batch LibreOffice SVG generation for best visual fidelity
  - Fallback: ElementTree-based SVG generation when LibreOffice is unavailable
  - Text extraction using python-pptx is consistent across both approaches

- **Audit Service Language Choice:** Go was selected for the Audit Service due to its:
  - High performance for read-heavy workloads
  - Strong concurrency model for handling multiple requests
  - Type safety and memory efficiency
  - Excellent standard library for HTTP services

- **Authentication Strategy:** 
  - JWT tokens for normal user authentication
  - Share tokens for limited access (e.g., for reviewers)
  - Caching validated tokens to reduce validation overhead
  - Common authorization logic in both frontend and microservices

- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is crucial throughout all services:
  - Domain-specific error types in each service
  - Consistent error response formats
  - Detailed logging with request IDs for traceability
  - Graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms
  - Store error states for UI feedback

- **Performance Considerations:** 
  - Monitor SVG rendering performance, especially for complex slides
  - Consider optimization techniques for presentations with many slides
  - Implement proper cleanup of temporary files in the processor service
  - Use connection pooling and caching in the Audit Service
  - Consider adding pagination controls to all list views
  - Zustand store should implement selective subscriptions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Monitor store size and serialization performance for persistence

- **Deployment Strategy:**
  - Containerize all microservices for consistent deployment
  - Implement health checks and monitoring
  - Consider using Kubernetes for orchestration
  - Implement proper logging and metrics collection

- **UI Consistency:** The recently implemented profile and settings pages maintain consistent UI patterns with the rest of the application, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- **Feature Prioritization:**
  - Focus on the core PPTX translation functionality first
  - Comments System will be implemented in a future phase (store structure is prepared)
  - Prioritize audit logging for critical user actions (editing, exporting, sharing)
  - Complete state management integration before adding new features
  - Add persistence and offline support as secondary priority

## 6. Share Service Implementation (Further Refinement & Testing Needed)

The Share Service enables secure, token-based sharing of translation sessions. Key components implemented include:

- **Backend Functionality:**
  - Secure JWT generation (`jose`) for share tokens with embedded permissions (View, Comment) and expiry.
  - CRUD-like operations for shares (create, list per session, revoke by JTI) via Hono API endpoints.
  - Token validation endpoint.
  - Supabase integration for storing share metadata in `session_shares` table (schema defined, assumed).
  - Authentication middleware for protecting management endpoints; rate limiting applied.

- **Frontend Integration:**
  - Zustand store (`share-slice`) for managing share state and interactions.
  - API client for communication with the share service.
  - UI modal (`ShareSessionModal`) for managing shares (generate, list, revoke).
  - Shared link handling page (`app/shared/[token]`) to validate tokens and set context for editor access.
  
- **Current Status & Next Steps:**
  - Core backend and frontend structures are in place.
  - **Critical:** Resolve backend `c.req.valid('json')` type error in `shareController.ts`.
  - **Critical:** Resolve frontend `@/types/share` path alias / module resolution.
  - Backend needs update to store/return full `share_url` for listed shares to enable copy functionality.
  - Editor page needs to be adapted to respect shared roles/permissions.
  - Thorough end-to-end testing is required.
   
- **Security Considerations (Implemented/Considered):**
  - Token-based authentication with JWTs, server-side validation.
  - Configurable expiration times for tokens.
  - Granular permissions (View, Comment) embedded in tokens.
  - Rate limiting on API endpoints.
  - Audit logging for share actions should be integrated via the existing Audit Service (not yet explicitly done for share actions).
