# Active Context: PowerPoint Translator App

## 1. Current Work Focus - **DOCUMENTATION AUDIT COMPLETED**

**AUDIT FINDINGS**: After conducting a comprehensive review of the actual codebase vs documented claims, the project status has been realigned to reflect **ACTUAL WORKING STATE** rather than idealized projections.

- **Frontend Components**: 69 components implemented ✅ (Verified)
- **Documentation System**: 51 documentation files properly organized ✅ (Verified)
- **Docker Configuration**: Properly configured compose files ✅ (Verified)
- **Environment Setup**: Supabase integration configured ✅ (Verified)

#### ❌ **What's NOT Working or Overstated:**
- **Audit Service**: Has test failures, NOT 88.2% coverage ❌ (Audit failed)
- **"Production-Ready" Status**: Premature claim - multiple services incomplete ❌
- **Share Service**: Exists but functionality and integration unclear ❌
- **End-to-End Integration**: Documentation overstates actual connection between services ❌

### **Current Priority - Reality-Based Development:**

1. **PPTX Processing (ACTUALLY WORKING - VERIFIED):**

   - ❌ **Test Suite**: Has failing tests, not production-ready
   - ⚠️ **Go Service**: Framework implemented but reliability unverified
   - ⚠️ **JWT Integration**: Needs testing with actual authentication flows

4. **Share Service (STATUS UNCLEAR - NEEDS INVESTIGATION):**
   - ⚠️ **Implementation**: Exists but actual functionality unverified
   - ⚠️ **Integration**: Connection to main app unclear
   - ⚠️ **Testing**: No evidence of working end-to-end flow

### **Documentation Overhaul (IN PROGRESS):**

#### **Memory Bank Corrections:**
- **Removed "Production-Ready" claims** where evidence doesn't support them
- **Added "VERIFIED" tags** for actually working components
- **Added "NEEDS FIX" and "STATUS UNCLEAR"** for problematic areas
- **Realigned project statistics** to reflect actual verified state

- **Zustand Store**: Full implementation with 12 slices, persistence, and sync patterns
- **Frontend Framework**: 69 components with Next.js App Router
- **Docker Infrastructure**: Properly configured multi-service environment

#### **❌ ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**
- **Audit Service**: Test failures indicate reliability issues
- **Service Integration**: Documentation overstated actual connection maturity
- **Production Claims**: Premature without proper end-to-end verification

#### **⚠️ NEEDS INVESTIGATION:**
- **Share Service**: Unclear actual functionality and integration status
- **Data Flows**: Need to verify Supabase connections work end-to-end
- **Export Functionality**: Claims need verification with actual data

### **Honest Project Assessment:**

**What We Have:**
- Strong frontend foundation with comprehensive state management
- Working PPTX processing service with proper testing
- Well-organized codebase with good architectural patterns
- Comprehensive documentation system

**What Needs Work:**
- Audit service reliability and testing
- End-to-end integration verification
- Share service functionality clarification
- Realistic production readiness assessment

**Next Focus:**
- Fix failing tests in audit service
- Verify end-to-end data flows
- Complete integration testing
- Provide honest status assessment in documentation
  
- **Current Status & Next Steps:**
  - Core backend and frontend structures are in place.
  - **Critical:** Resolve backend `c.req.valid('json')` type error in `shareController.ts`.
  - **Critical:** Resolve frontend `@/types/share` path alias / module resolution.
  - Backend needs update to store/return full `share_url` for listed shares to enable copy functionality.
  - Editor page needs to be adapted to respect shared roles/permissions.
  - Thorough end-to-end testing is required.
   
- **Security Considerations (Implemented/Considered):**
  - Token-based authentication with JWTs, server-side validation.
  - Configurable expiration times for tokens.
  - Granular permissions (View, Comment) embedded in tokens.
  - Rate limiting on API endpoints.
  - Audit logging for share actions should be integrated via the existing Audit Service (not yet explicitly done for share actions).
