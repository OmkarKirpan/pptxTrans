- **Upload Wizard Enhancement (COMPLETED):**
  - Fixed an issue where the "Create Translation Session" button in the configure step could be clicked multiple times if backend processing was slow.
  - Introduced `isProcessingSubmittedConfig` state in `upload-wizard.tsx` to disable the button throughout the entire session creation and PPTX processing flow.

- **Editor Integration & Refinement (COMPLETED):**
  - Refactored `app/editor/[sessionId]/page.tsx` to use Zustand store for all data management.
  - Removed mock slide data and direct Supabase calls for fetching slides.
  - Integrated `fetchSessionDetails(sessionId)` from `useTranslationSessions()` for session metadata.
  - Integrated `fetchSlidesForSession(sessionId)` from `useSlides()` for slide and shape data.
  - `lib/store/slices/slides-slice.ts`:
    - Added `fetchSlidesForSession(sessionId)` action.
    - Refactored `syncSlidesOrder` action.
    - Corrected Supabase table names and type mismatches for `ProcessedSlide`.
  - `lib/store/slices/edit-buffers-slice.ts`:
    - Modified `saveBuffer` to use `updateShape()` from `slidesSlice` for persistence.
  - Ensured `updateLastOpenedAt(sessionId)` is called when the editor opens.
  - Updated loading and error state handling to use states from Zustand slices.
  - Adjusted real-time subscription logic (`subscribeToSession`) to activate after initial data load.
  - Corrected `AuditAction` types in `createAuditEvent` calls (e.g., 'read' to 'view').
  - Fixed prop usage for `DashboardHeader` and `SyncStatusIndicator`.
  - Re-implemented handler functions (`handleExport`, `handleTextClick`, etc.) for store-based data flow.

- **Type Standardization for `TranslationSession` (COMPLETED):**
  - Resolved type conflicts by standardizing on the API model `ApiTranslationSession` from `types/api/index.ts`.
  - Refactored `components/dashboard/session-card.tsx` to use `ApiTranslationSession`, adjusting internal logic for field access, status mapping, progress calculation, and thumbnail display.
  - Refactored `app/dashboard/page.tsx` to remove local mapping functions and pass `ApiTranslationSession` objects directly to `SessionCard`.
  - Removed the legacy `TranslationSession` interface from `types/index.ts`.
  - Identified `session-slice.ts` (using legacy model) for future cleanup.

- **Session Status Flow - Phase 1 (COMPLETED):**
  - `lib/store/slices/translationSessionsSlice.ts`:
    - Added `markSessionInProgress(sessionId)` and `markSessionCompleted(sessionId)` actions.
    - Corrected `fetchSessions` to handle union return type for `ApiTranslationSession[] | PaginatedSessions<ApiTranslationSession>`.
  - `lib/store/index.ts`: Updated `useTranslationSessions` hook to expose new status actions.
  - `app/editor/[sessionId]/page.tsx`:
    - Integrated status transition actions:
      - 'draft' -> 'in_progress' automatically on load.
      - 'in_progress' -> 'completed' via a "Mark as Complete" button in `DashboardHeader`.
    - "Export PPTX" button is now disabled if session status is not 'completed'.

- **Share Service Implementation (Further Refinement & Testing Needed):**

    - Applied rate limiting to share service endpoints.
    - Configured Hono routes in `src/index.ts` for the share API.
    - *Critical Pending Issue:* A persistent linter error in `shareController.ts` related to `c.req.valid('json')` type inference needs resolution (likely a Hono/zod-validator versioning or TS environment issue).
    - *Needed for UI:* Backend must be updated to store and return the full `share_url` in the `ShareRecord` when shares are listed to enable the "Copy Link" feature for existing shares.
  - **Frontend (Next.js/Zustand):**
    - Created API client functions (`lib/api/shareApi.ts`) to communicate with the backend Share Service.
    - Defined frontend type definitions (`types/share.ts`) mirroring backend models.
    - Implemented a Zustand store slice (`lib/store/slices/share-slice.ts`) for managing share-related state (session shares, loading/error states) and actions.
    - Integrated the share slice into the main Zustand store (`lib/store/index.ts` and `lib/store/types.ts`).
    - Developed `ShareSessionModal.tsx` UI component for generating, viewing, and revoking share links.
    - Integrated the `ShareSessionModal` into `SessionCard.tsx`.
    - Created `app/shared/[token]/page.tsx` for handling incoming shared links, validating tokens, setting session context (role, shareToken), and redirecting to the editor.
    - *Pending Issue:* Potential `Cannot find module '@/types/share'` path alias issue to be resolved in local environment.

## 3. Next Immediate Steps

1.  **Session Status Flow - Dashboard UI Enhancements (COMPLETED):**
    *   **Goal:** Visually represent session statuses in the `SessionCard`.
    *   **Outcome:** `SessionCard` now displays status badges with distinct styles for `draft`, `in_progress`, `completed`, and `archived` based on `ApiTranslationSession['status']`. Legacy status mapping was removed.

2.  **Review and Cleanup `useSession` / `session-slice.ts` (COMPLETED):**
    *   **Goal:** Remove or refactor the old `session-slice.ts` and its associated `useSession` hook, as its functionality has largely been superseded by `translationSessionsSlice` and direct user/auth context.
    *   **Outcome:** `session-slice.ts` and the `useSession` hook have been significantly refactored. The slice now primarily manages `userRole` and `shareToken`, along with the `clearSession()` action. The legacy `currentSession` (and its problematic type) and associated loading/error states have been removed from this slice. Dependent components (`app/dashboard/new-session/page.tsx`, `components/dashboard/upload-wizard.tsx`, `app/dashboard/page.tsx`) have been updated to reflect these changes and rely on `translationSessionsSlice` or local state where appropriate.

3. **Editor Integration - Final Review (COMPLETED):**
    *   **Goal:** Perform a thorough review of the `app/editor/[sessionId]/page.tsx` and its interactions with Zustand stores.
    *   **Outcome:** Review completed. The editor page demonstrates solid integration with `slidesSlice`, `editBuffersSlice`, and `translationSessionsSlice`. Data flow, real-time updates, status transitions, error handling, and audit logging are generally well-implemented. No critical issues found that require immediate remediation.

4.  **Implement `TranslationSessionService` (COMPLETED):**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the Hono.js/Bun.js service for managing translation session metadata is fully functional and correctly integrated.
    *   **Outcome:** The `translation-session-service` has been reviewed and verified. It includes:
        *   Correct Supabase client setup and environment variable usage.
        *   Well-defined models (`TranslationSession`, payloads) consistent with frontend types.
        *   Robust controller logic for CRUD operations (create, list with pagination/sort/filter, get by ID, update, delete) including Zod input validation and strict user ownership checks.
        *   Secure Hono routing with an `authMiddleware` validating Supabase JWTs for all session endpoints.
        *   Proper CORS configuration and a logging middleware.
        *   API versioning at `/api/v1/sessions`.
        *   Necessary scripts (`start`, `dev`) in `package.json`.
        *   The frontend API client (`lib/api/translationSessionApi.ts`) has been updated to correctly target the service's versioned endpoints.
    *   The service is deemed implemented and ready for deployment/use.

5.  **Frontend Integration for Translation Sessions (COMPLETED):**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure all frontend components correctly use the `TranslationSessionService` via `translationSessionsSlice` and `translationSessionApi.ts`.
    *   **Outcome:** Verification completed. Key frontend integration points were reviewed:
        *   **`UploadWizard`**: Correctly calls `createSession` via the store, which maps to the `POST /api/v1/sessions/` service endpoint. Payload matches.
        *   **Dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)**: Session deletion correctly calls `deleteSession` via the store, mapping to `DELETE /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId`.
        *   **Editor Page (`app/editor/[sessionId]/page.tsx`)**: Correctly calls `fetchSessionDetails` (for `GET /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId`) and `updateLastOpenedAt` (which uses `updateSession` for `PATCH /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId`) via the store and API client.
    *   The frontend integration with the `TranslationSessionService` for core CRUD operations appears correct and robust.

6. **Resolve Share Service Backend Linter Error:** Address the `c.req.valid('json')` type inference issue in `services/share-service/src/controllers/shareController.ts`.
7. **Resolve Frontend Path Alias Issue:** Ensure `tsconfig.json` path aliases (e.g., for `@/types/share`) are correct and recognized.
8. **Backend Update for Share Link Copying:** Modify share service to store and return `share_url` in `ShareRecord` for listed shares.
9. **Adapt Editor for Shared Access:** Update `app/editor/[sessionId]/page.tsx` to restrict functionality based on `userRole` and `shareToken` from Zustand store.
10. **Share Service End-to-End Testing:** Thoroughly test the complete sharing flow.
11. **Enhance Comment System with Real-time Updates:**

- **Architecture Choice:** The decision to use separate microservices for PPTX processing and audit logging is confirmed as the right approach. This provides better separation of concerns, scalability, and language-specific optimizations.

- **Processing Pipeline:** The current pipeline uses a hybrid approach:
  - Primary: Batch LibreOffice SVG generation for best visual fidelity
  - Fallback: ElementTree-based SVG generation when LibreOffice is unavailable
  - Text extraction using python-pptx is consistent across both approaches

- **Audit Service Language Choice:** Go was selected for the Audit Service due to its:
  - High performance for read-heavy workloads
  - Strong concurrency model for handling multiple requests
  - Type safety and memory efficiency
  - Excellent standard library for HTTP services

- **Authentication Strategy:** 
  - JWT tokens for normal user authentication
  - Share tokens for limited access (e.g., for reviewers)
  - Caching validated tokens to reduce validation overhead
  - Common authorization logic in both frontend and microservices

- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is crucial throughout all services:
  - Domain-specific error types in each service
  - Consistent error response formats
  - Detailed logging with request IDs for traceability
  - Graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms
  - Store error states for UI feedback

- **Performance Considerations:** 
  - Monitor SVG rendering performance, especially for complex slides
  - Consider optimization techniques for presentations with many slides
  - Implement proper cleanup of temporary files in the processor service
  - Use connection pooling and caching in the Audit Service
  - Consider adding pagination controls to all list views
  - Zustand store should implement selective subscriptions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Monitor store size and serialization performance for persistence

- **Deployment Strategy:**
  - Containerize all microservices for consistent deployment
  - Implement health checks and monitoring
  - Consider using Kubernetes for orchestration
  - Implement proper logging and metrics collection

- **UI Consistency:** The recently implemented profile and settings pages maintain consistent UI patterns with the rest of the application, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- **Feature Prioritization:**
  - Focus on the core PPTX translation functionality first
  - Comments System will be implemented in a future phase (store structure is prepared)
  - Prioritize audit logging for critical user actions (editing, exporting, sharing)
  - Complete state management integration before adding new features
  - Add persistence and offline support as secondary priority

## 5. Share Service Implementation (Further Refinement & Testing Needed)

The Share Service enables secure, token-based sharing of translation sessions. Key components implemented include:

- **Backend Functionality:**
  - Secure JWT generation (`jose`) for share tokens with embedded permissions (View, Comment) and expiry.
  - CRUD-like operations for shares (create, list per session, revoke by JTI) via Hono API endpoints.
  - Token validation endpoint.
  - Supabase integration for storing share metadata in `session_shares` table (schema defined, assumed).
  - Authentication middleware for protecting management endpoints; rate limiting applied.

- **Frontend Integration:**
  - Zustand store (`share-slice`) for managing share state and interactions.
  - API client for communication with the share service.
  - UI modal (`ShareSessionModal`) for managing shares (generate, list, revoke).
  - Shared link handling page (`app/shared/[token]`) to validate tokens and set context for editor access.
  
- **Current Status & Next Steps:**
  - Core backend and frontend structures are in place.
  - **Critical:** Resolve backend `c.req.valid('json')` type error in `shareController.ts`.
  - **Critical:** Resolve frontend `@/types/share` path alias / module resolution.
  - Backend needs update to store/return full `share_url` for listed shares to enable copy functionality.
  - Editor page needs to be adapted to respect shared roles/permissions.
  - Thorough end-to-end testing is required.
   
- **Security Considerations (Implemented/Considered):**
  - Token-based authentication with JWTs, server-side validation.
  - Configurable expiration times for tokens.
  - Granular permissions (View, Comment) embedded in tokens.
  - Rate limiting on API endpoints.
  - Audit logging for share actions should be integrated via the existing Audit Service (not yet explicitly done for share actions).
