# Technical Context: PowerPoint Translator App

## 1. Core Technologies
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router) with React 18+ and TypeScript.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, complemented by shadcn/ui for pre-built, accessible components.
- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Supabase
    - **Authentication:** Supabase Auth for email/password login and user management.
    - **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL for storing user data, translation sessions, slide metadata, text elements, and comments.
    - **Storage:** Supabase Storage for hosting original PPTX files, server-generated SVG slide representations, and potentially translated PPTX files.
- **State Management:** Primarily React's built-in context and state hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`). Complex global state might later involve Zustand or Jotai if deemed necessary.

## 2. Key Libraries & Tools (Planned/Conceptual)
- **Server-Side PPTX Processing (Conceptual - External Service/Backend):**
    - A robust solution (e.g., Aspose.Slides, GroupDocs.Viewer, LibreOffice in headless mode, or a dedicated microservice) is required to:
        1.  Convert individual PowerPoint slides to SVG format for high-fidelity web rendering.
        2.  Extract text content, positioning data (x, y, width, height), basic styling (font size, bold, italic), and reading order from PPTX shapes.
    - This processing is assumed to be triggered via an API call from the Next.js application.
- **PPTX Generation (Conceptual - for Export):**
    - `PptxGenJS` or a similar library will be used to programmatically reconstruct a new PPTX file using the original slide structure/images and the translated text content.

## 3. Development & Preview Environment
- **v0 AI Assistant:** Code generation and iteration assistance.
- **Next.js Lite (v0 Preview):** The runtime environment for previews generated by v0. This environment has limitations, particularly regarding server-side execution of binaries or complex file system operations needed for PPTX conversion.

## 4. Technical Constraints & Considerations
- **PPTX Conversion Complexity:** The core challenge is the server-side conversion of PPTX files. This cannot be directly handled within Next.js Lite or standard Vercel serverless functions due to the need for specialized binaries or SDKs. This part of the system will be conceptually designed and will require a separate, more capable backend environment for full implementation.
- **SVG Rendering & Interactivity:** Ensuring accurate and performant rendering of SVGs and interactive overlays for potentially many text elements per slide.
- **Data Synchronization:** Keeping client-side state, database records, and potentially file storage in sync, especially during collaborative editing.
- **Scalability:** While the MVP focuses on core features, the architecture should allow for future scaling of users and data. Supabase provides a good foundation for this.
