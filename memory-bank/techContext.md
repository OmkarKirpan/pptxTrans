# Technical Context: PowerPoint Translator App

## 1. Core Technologies
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router) with React 18+ and TypeScript.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, complemented by shadcn/ui for pre-built, accessible components.
- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Supabase
    - **Authentication:** Supabase Auth for email/password login and user management.
    - **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL for storing user data, translation sessions, slide metadata, text elements, and comments.
    - **Storage:** Supabase Storage for hosting original PPTX files, server-generated SVG slide representations, and potentially translated PPTX files.
- **PPTX Processor Service:** Python FastAPI microservice
    - **Core Libraries:** python-pptx for PPTX parsing, LibreOffice for high-quality conversion
    - **Background Processing:** Asynchronous task handling with asyncio
    - **Supabase Integration:** Direct connection to Supabase for storage and database operations
- **State Management:** Primarily React's built-in context and state hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`). Complex global state might later involve Zustand or Jotai if deemed necessary.

## 2. Key Libraries & Tools
- **Server-Side PPTX Processing:**
    - **Python FastAPI:** Framework for building the processor microservice
    - **LibreOffice:** Used in headless mode for high-quality PPTX to SVG conversion
    - **python-pptx:** For parsing PPTX files and extracting text and metadata
    - **CairoSVG:** For SVG manipulation and thumbnails (fallback conversion)
    - **Supabase Python SDK:** For storage and database operations from the processor
- **Frontend Libraries:**
    - **shadcn/ui:** Component library built on Radix UI for accessible, customizable UI elements
    - **PptxGenJS:** (Planned) For programmatically reconstructing PPTX files during export
    - **Supabase JS SDK:** For authentication, database, and storage operations

## 3. Development & Preview Environment
- **v0 AI Assistant:** Code generation and iteration assistance.
- **Next.js Development:** Local development with `next dev`
- **PPTX Processor Service:** Local development with Python virtual environment
    - Requires LibreOffice installation for full functionality
    - Can run with fallback mechanisms for basic development
- **Next.js Lite (v0 Preview):** The runtime environment for previews generated by v0. This environment has limitations for server-side execution of binaries, requiring the separate microservice approach.

## 4. Technical Constraints & Considerations
- **Microservice Architecture:** The separation of the PPTX processing into its own microservice solves the challenges of running specialized tools like LibreOffice, which can't be executed within serverless functions.

- **Deployment Complexity:** The processor service requires a non-serverless environment with support for installing LibreOffice, making deployment more complex than a standard Next.js application.

- **API Communication:** Efficient and robust communication between the Next.js frontend and the processor service is critical, including proper handling of large file uploads and asynchronous processing.

- **SVG Rendering & Interactivity:** Ensuring accurate and performant rendering of SVGs and interactive overlays for potentially many text elements per slide.

- **Data Synchronization:** Keeping client-side state, database records, and file storage in sync, especially during collaborative editing.

- **Scalability:** While the MVP focuses on core features, the architecture should allow for future scaling of users and data. The processor service might need horizontal scaling for handling multiple concurrent conversions.

- **Security:** Both the frontend and processor service must implement proper authentication and authorization checks when accessing Supabase resources.
