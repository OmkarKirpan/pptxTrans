# Progress: PowerPoint Translator App

## 1. What Works / Implemented Features
(Note: Some features rely on mock data or conceptual backend processes.)

- **User Authentication:**
    - Login Page (`app/auth/login/page.tsx`): Functional with Supabase email/password authentication.
    - Signup Page (`app/auth/signup/page.tsx`): Functional with Supabase email/password registration, including basic password validation and confirmation messages.
- **Database Setup (Supabase PostgreSQL):**
    - `translation_sessions` table: Created, seeded with sample data. RLS policies in place.
    - `slides` table: Created for storing SVG URLs and slide metadata. RLS policies in place.
    - `slide_shapes` table: Created for storing text element data, coordinates, and translations. RLS policies in place.
- **Dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`):**
    - Basic structure with `DashboardHeader` (user menu, logout, "New Session" button).
    - Fetches and displays `translation_sessions` for the authenticated user from Supabase.
    - `SessionCard` component displays session info (name, date, progress, status, slide count). Actions (share, export, delete) are placeholders.
    - `EmptyState` component shown when no sessions exist.
- **New Session Creation (`app/dashboard/new-session/page.tsx`):**
    - `UploadWizard` component with a 3-step UI flow:
        1.  **Upload:** Drag-and-drop, file browser, mock progress for PPTX.
        2.  **Configure:** Inputs for session name, language selection (mock languages). Mock parsing indicator.
        3.  **Success:** Confirmation message, placeholder for first slide preview.
    - Fetches current user for association (actual session creation in Supabase via wizard is pending full processing pipeline).
- **Slide Editor (`app/editor/[sessionId]/page.tsx`):**
    - Basic 3-column layout (Slide Navigator, Slide Canvas, Comments Panel).
    - **`SlideCanvas`:**
        - Refactored to display a slide's SVG image (from `ProcessedSlide.svg_url`) as the background, maintaining aspect ratio.
        - Overlays interactive, transparent HTML elements for text shapes based on coordinates from `ProcessedSlide.shapes`.
        - Handles click events on text overlays to open an editing dialog.
        - Uses mock `ProcessedSlide` data for now.
    - **Text Editing Dialog:**
        - Pops up with original text and an input for translation.
        - "Save" button updates local state (optimistic update) and attempts to save the `translated_text` to the `slide_shapes` table in Supabase.
    - `SlideNavigator`: Displays mock slide thumbnails. Selection updates `currentSlide` in the editor. (Needs update for `ProcessedSlide` data).
    - `CommentsPanel`: Placeholder UI.
- **Core Types:** Defined in `types/index.ts` for `TranslationSession`, `ProcessedSlide`, `SlideShape`.
- **Supabase Client Setup:** Client-side (`lib/supabase/client.ts`) and server-side (`lib/supabase/server.ts`) Supabase client initializers are in place.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Key Pending Areas
- **Core PPTX Processing Backend:**
    - **The actual server-side service/logic for converting uploaded PPTX files to SVGs and extracting detailed shape/text data.** This is the most critical missing piece and requires an environment capable of running specialized tools (external to Next.js Lite).
- **`UploadWizard` Full Integration:**
    - Real file upload to Supabase Storage.
    - Triggering the (conceptual) `/api/process-pptx` after successful upload and `translation_sessions` record creation.
    - Handling the asynchronous response/status of the processing (e.g., polling, Realtime updates).
    - Updating `translation_sessions` with `slide_count` and status upon successful processing.
- **Slide Editor Full Functionality:**
    - **Real Data Fetching:** Load actual `ProcessedSlide` and `SlideShape` data from Supabase based on `sessionId`.
    - **`SlideNavigator` Update:** Integrate with `ProcessedSlide` data, using `svg_url` for thumbnails.
    - **Comments & Collaboration:** Implement `CommentThread`, `CommentForm`, and backend logic for adding, viewing, and resolving comments on `slide_shapes`.
    - **Text Merge Interface:** UI and logic for selecting and merging multiple text runs.
    - **Reading Order Interface:** UI for visualizing and reordering text elements (if reading order data can be reliably extracted).
    - **Saving All Changes:** Robust mechanism for saving all slide and shape modifications.
- **Export Functionality:**
    - **Export Interface:** UI for selecting export options.
    - **PPTX Reconstruction:** Logic (likely using `PptxGenJS`) to generate a new PPTX file using the original slide structure (potentially from SVGs/images) and the translated text from `slide_shapes`.
    - Uploading translated PPTX to Supabase Storage and providing a download link.
- **Share Page/Functionality:** UI and logic for generating and managing shareable links to translation sessions (view-only or collaborative).
- **User Profile & Settings Pages:** Basic pages for users to manage their profile and application settings.
- **UI Polish & UX Refinements:**
    - Consistent and comprehensive loading states and skeletons.
    - Detailed error handling and user feedback messages.
    - Responsive design improvements for tablet and smaller desktop views.
    - Subtle animations and micro-interactions as per the design brief.
- **Testing:** Unit and integration tests.

## 3. Current Overall Status
The foundational UI for authentication, dashboard, and the new session wizard is in place. The Slide Editor has been architected around the high-fidelity SVG rendering approach, with key components like `SlideCanvas` refactored to support this. Data models for processed slides are defined in the database. The main blocker for full end-to-end functionality is the implementation of the server-side PPTX processing pipeline. Current development is focused on building out the client-side editor features using mock processed data, in anticipation of the backend processing capability.

## 4. Known Issues & Challenges
- **PPTX Processing Dependency:** The entire slide editing experience hinges on the successful server-side conversion of PPTX to SVG and structured data. This requires a backend solution external to the Next.js Lite environment.
- **SVG and Overlay Performance:** Rendering potentially complex SVGs and numerous interactive overlays for slides with many text elements needs to be monitored for performance.
- **Data Consistency:** Ensuring data consistency between the client state, the Supabase database, and any cached data, especially with optimistic updates.
- **Real-time Collaboration (Future):** If real-time collaboration is a future goal, further architectural considerations (e.g., Supabase Realtime, CRDTs) will be needed.
