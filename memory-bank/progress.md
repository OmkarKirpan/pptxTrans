    - ✅ Prevention of multiple submissions during session creation and PPTX processing
  - ✅ Session card with thumbnail (now uses `ApiTranslationSession` model)
  - ✅ Session details view
  - ✅ Share functionality
  - ✅ Session deletion
  - ✅ Page now consumes `ApiTranslationSession` directly, removing local mapping.

- **User Profile & Settings:**
  - ✅ Profile information update

  - ✅ Slides slice for slide data and navigation
  - ✅ Edit buffers slice for tracking unsaved changes
  - ✅ Comments slice for slide/shape comments
  - ✅ Notifications slice for system notifications
  - ✅ Merge slice for merge operations
  - ✅ Main store combining all slices
  - ✅ Custom hooks for accessing store state

  - ✅ Drag-and-drop slide reordering
  - ✅ Documentation in README.md
  - ✅ `slidesSlice`: `fetchSlidesForSession` action to load slides and shapes.
  - ✅ `slidesSlice`: Refactored `syncSlidesOrder`.
  - ✅ `editBuffersSlice`: `saveBuffer` action now updates `slidesSlice` for persistence.
  - ✅ `translationSessionsSlice`: `markSessionInProgress` and `markSessionCompleted` actions.
  - ✅ Standardized on `ApiTranslationSession` type from `types/api/index.ts`, removing legacy `TranslationSession` from `types/index.ts`.
  - ✅ Selective subscriptions for performance (implemented, tested, and documented)

- **Slide Editor:**
  - ✅ SVG-based slide rendering

  - ✅ Data fetching via Zustand:
    - `useTranslationSessions().fetchSessionDetails(sessionId)` for session metadata.
    - `useSlides().fetchSlidesForSession(sessionId)` for slide and shape data.
  - ✅ Calls `updateLastOpenedAt(sessionId)` on editor open.
  - ✅ Session status transitions:
    - Automatically transitions from 'draft' to 'in_progress' on load.
    - "Mark as Complete" button to transition from 'in_progress' to 'completed'.
  - ✅ "Export PPTX" button disabled unless session status is 'completed'.
  - ✅ Corrected prop usage for `DashboardHeader` and `SyncStatusIndicator`.

  - **Status:** Core backend and frontend structures implemented. Critical linter/type issues pending in both backend controller and frontend imports. Backend requires modification to store and return full share URLs for copy functionality. Editor page adaptation for shared roles is pending. Full end-to-end testing needed.
  - **Components:**
    - **Backend (Hono.js Service - `services/share-service`):**
        - JWT Utilities (`src/utils/jwt.ts`): Implemented.
        - Database Repository (`src/db/shareRepository.ts`): Implemented for `session_shares` table.
        - Models (`src/models/share.ts`): Defined.
        - Controllers (`src/controllers/shareController.ts`): Implemented; **has critical `c.req.valid('json')` type error.**
        - Auth Middleware (`src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts`): Implemented.
        - Rate Limiting: Applied.
        - Routing (`src/index.ts`): Implemented.
    - **Frontend (Next.js App):**
        - API Client (`lib/api/shareApi.ts`): Implemented; **has potential `@/types/share` path alias issue.**
        - Type Definitions (`types/share.ts`): Defined.
        - Zustand Slice (`lib/store/slices/share-slice.ts`): Implemented.
        - Store Integration (`lib/store/index.ts`, `lib/store/types.ts`): Done; **may have lingering type resolution issues pending local TS server sync.**
        - Share Modal UI (`components/dashboard/share-session-modal.tsx`): Implemented.
        - Modal Integration (`components/dashboard/session-card.tsx`): Done.
        - Shared Access Page (`app/shared/[token]/page.tsx`): Implemented.
  - **What Works:**
    - Backend service structure, JWT generation/validation, DB interaction logic (conceptual, pending controller fix).
    - Frontend API client, Zustand store for shares, UI modal for share management (generation, listing, revocation), shared link handling page.
  - **What's Next / In Progress:**
    1.  **Resolve Critical Backend Linter Error:** Fix `c.req.valid('json')` type issue in `shareController.ts`.
    2.  **Resolve Critical Frontend Path Alias:** Ensure `@/types/share` (and similar) resolve correctly.
    3.  **Run `bun install`:** Ensure all dependencies (immer, uuid, etc.) are installed in both frontend and backend service.
    4.  **Backend: Store and Return `share_url`:** Modify `shareRepository.ts` and `ShareRecord` model to include the full shareable URL when listing shares.
    5.  **Frontend: Adapt Editor Page:** Modify `app/editor/[sessionId]/page.tsx` to consume `userRole` and `shareToken` from store, restricting UI/actions accordingly.
    6.  **Testing:** Conduct thorough end-to-end testing of the sharing flow.
    7.  **Audit Logging:** Integrate audit logging for share-related actions.
