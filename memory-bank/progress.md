# Progress: PowerPoint Translator App

## 1. What Works / Implemented Features
(Note: Some features in the frontend still rely on mock data until full integration is completed.)

- **User Authentication:**
    - Login Page (`app/auth/login/page.tsx`): Functional with Supabase email/password authentication. Enhanced with support for success messages from password reset flow.
    - Signup Page (`app/auth/signup/page.tsx`): Functional with Supabase email/password registration, including basic password validation and confirmation messages.
    - **Forgot Password Flow (COMPLETED):**
        - Forgot Password Request Page (`app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx`): Complete email input form with Supabase integration
        - Password Reset Page (`app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx`): Complete password update form with session validation
        - Auth Callback Handler (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`): Handles email link redirects for password reset
        - Full security implementation with generic messages and proper session handling

- **PPTX Processor Service:**
    - Standalone Python FastAPI microservice (`pptx-processor-service/`) for handling PPTX conversion
    - `/v1/process` endpoint for receiving PPTX files and session metadata
    - Background task processing for asynchronous handling of conversions
    - LibreOffice integration for high-quality SVG conversion of slides
    - Text extraction with coordinate data for interactive overlays
    - Supabase integration for storing generated assets and updating database
    - Job status tracking and retrieval endpoints

- **Database Setup (Supabase PostgreSQL):**
    - `translation_sessions` table: Created, seeded with sample data. RLS policies in place.
    - `slides` table: Created for storing SVG URLs and slide metadata. RLS policies in place.
    - `slide_shapes` table: Created for storing text element data, coordinates, and translations. RLS policies in place.

- **Dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`):**
    - Basic structure with `DashboardHeader` (user menu, logout, "New Session" button).
    - Fetches and displays `translation_sessions` for the authenticated user from Supabase.
    - `SessionCard` component displays session info (name, date, progress, status, slide count). Actions (share, export, delete) are placeholders.
    - `EmptyState` component shown when no sessions exist.

- **New Session Creation (`app/dashboard/new-session/page.tsx`):**
    - `UploadWizard` component with a 3-step UI flow:
        1. **Upload:** Drag-and-drop, file browser, mock progress for PPTX.
        2. **Configure:** Inputs for session name, language selection (mock languages). Mock parsing indicator.
        3. **Success:** Confirmation message, placeholder for first slide preview.
    - Fetches current user for association (actual session creation in Supabase via wizard is pending full processing pipeline).

- **Slide Editor (`app/editor/[sessionId]/page.tsx`):**
    - Basic 3-column layout (Slide Navigator, Slide Canvas, Comments Panel).
    - **`SlideCanvas`:**
        - Displays a slide's SVG image (from `ProcessedSlide.svg_url`) as the background, maintaining aspect ratio.
        - Overlays interactive, transparent HTML elements for text shapes based on coordinates from `ProcessedSlide.shapes`.
        - Handles click events on text overlays to open an editing dialog.
        - Uses mock `ProcessedSlide` data for now.
    - **Text Editing Dialog:**
        - Pops up with original text and an input for translation.
        - "Save" button updates local state (optimistic update) and attempts to save the `translated_text` to the `slide_shapes` table in Supabase.
    - `SlideNavigator`: Displays mock slide thumbnails. Selection updates `currentSlide` in the editor. (Needs update for `ProcessedSlide` data).
    - `CommentsPanel`: Placeholder UI.

- **Core Types:** Defined in `types/index.ts` for `TranslationSession`, `ProcessedSlide`, `SlideShape`.

- **Supabase Client Setup:** Client-side (`lib/supabase/client.ts`) and server-side (`lib/supabase/server.ts`) Supabase client initializers are in place. Updated for Next.js 15 compatibility with async cookies() handling.

## 3. Current Overall Status
The project has made significant progress with the implementation of both the frontend components and the PPTX processor service. The processor service is operational with LibreOffice integration for high-fidelity SVG generation and text extraction, solving one of the critical technical challenges. The frontend components for authentication, dashboard, and the slide editor structure are in place, with the key `SlideCanvas` component refactored to support the high-fidelity SVG rendering approach.

The main focus now is on connecting these two components - integrating the frontend with the processor service to enable end-to-end functionality from upload to editing. Once this integration is complete, the application will provide a solid foundation for translation functionality, with future efforts focused on enhancing the editing experience, collaboration features, and export capabilities.

## 4. Known Issues & Challenges

- **Integration Complexity:** Ensuring seamless integration between the Next.js frontend and the Python FastAPI processor service, especially for handling file uploads and processing status updates.

- **Deployment Configuration:** Setting up the appropriate deployment environment for the PPTX processor service, which requires LibreOffice and other dependencies that aren't typically available in serverless environments.

- **SVG and Overlay Performance:** Rendering potentially complex SVGs and numerous interactive overlays for slides with many text elements needs to be monitored for performance. Initial tests show good results, but optimization may be needed for very complex presentations.

- **Error Handling and Recovery:** Implementing robust error handling throughout the pipeline, with the ability to retry failed processing steps and provide clear feedback to users.

- **Data Consistency:** Ensuring data consistency between the client state, the Supabase database, and any cached data, especially with optimistic updates during text editing.

- **LibreOffice Dependency:** The processor service relies on LibreOffice for high-quality SVG conversion. While a fallback approach is implemented, the best results require LibreOffice to be properly installed and configured in the deployment environment.
