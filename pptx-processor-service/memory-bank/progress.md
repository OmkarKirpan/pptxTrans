# Progress Tracking

## What Works
- ✅ **API Framework**: FastAPI server running and accepting requests
- ✅ **File Upload**: PPTX files can be uploaded via multipart form data
- ✅ **Basic Processing**: File processing queue with background tasks
- ✅ **Supabase Integration**: Connected to local Supabase instance
- ✅ **Database Tables**: Created all required tables (translation_sessions, slides, slide_shapes, health_check)
- ✅ **Storage Buckets**: Configured slide-visuals and processing-results buckets
- ✅ **File Upload to Storage**: Successfully uploading SVGs and thumbnails to Supabase storage
- ✅ **SVG Generation**: Fallback SVG generation using ElementTree working
- ✅ **Thumbnail Generation**: Creating thumbnails with PIL
- ✅ **Text Extraction**: Extracting text with positioning and styling from slides
- ✅ **Slide Dimensions Fix**: Fixed slide width/height access from presentation object
- ✅ **RLS Configuration**: Disabled RLS for development to avoid permission issues
- ✅ **Retry Mechanism**: Added ability to retry failed jobs

## What's Partially Working
- ⚠️ **LibreOffice Integration**: Path configured but SVG conversion not producing output
  - LibreOffice is being called but not generating SVG files
  - Fallback to ElementTree SVG generation is working
- ⚠️ **Health Check**: Working but showing unhealthy Supabase connection sometimes

## What Needs Work
- ❌ **LibreOffice SVG Conversion**: Need to debug why LibreOffice isn't producing SVG files
  - Might need different command line arguments
  - Could be a Windows-specific path issue
- ❌ **Production RLS Policies**: Currently disabled for development
- ❌ **Batch Processing**: Endpoint exists but not thoroughly tested
- ❌ **Error Recovery**: Need better error handling for partial failures

## Known Issues
1. **LibreOffice**: Not generating SVG output on Windows
2. **Storage RLS**: Had to disable RLS on storage tables for development
3. **MSO_VERTICAL_ANCHOR**: Fixed incorrect enum values that don't exist in python-pptx

## Recent Fixes
1. Fixed slide dimensions access - now using `presentation.slide_width` instead of `slide.slide_width`
2. Fixed MSO_VERTICAL_ANCHOR enum mapping - removed non-existent attributes
3. Fixed Supabase URL validation with normalization
4. Fixed storage bucket creation to handle RLS errors gracefully
5. Added retry capability for failed jobs

## Next Steps
1. Debug LibreOffice SVG conversion on Windows
2. Test with various PPTX files to ensure robustness
3. Implement proper RLS policies for production
4. Add more comprehensive error handling
5. Optimize performance for large presentations
