# Progress Tracker

## What Works
- Basic project structure established and core dependencies identified.
- UV package manager successfully installed and configured.
- FastAPI application structure properly set up with API routes (processing, status, health).
- Data models/schemas are well-defined.
- Supabase integration for storage and job status updates.
- **Optimized Hybrid PPTX to SVG Conversion:**
    - Configurable LibreOffice path (`settings.LIBREOFFICE_PATH`).
    - Efficient batch SVG generation using a single LibreOffice call per presentation (`_generate_svgs_for_all_slides_libreoffice`).
    - ElementTree-based SVG generation as a reliable fallback (`create_svg_from_slide`).
    - Streamlined text, image, and metadata extraction using `python-pptx` (`extract_shapes`), called once per slide.
- **Enhanced Thumbnail Generation:**
    - `create_thumbnail_from_slide_pil` uses extracted shape data, actual slide background colors (solid fills), and renders embedded images.
- Fallback mechanisms ensure robustness (e.g., `create_minimal_svg`).
- Improved directory management for processing outputs and cleanup.
- App runs successfully on Windows, with CairoSVG dependency fully removed.

## What's In Progress
- Thorough testing with diverse and complex PPTX files.
- Benchmarking performance of the optimized conversion process.
- Integration with frontend slidecanvas component.

## What's Been Fixed/Improved
1.  **Cairo Library Dependency**: Completely removed, replaced with ElementTree and LibreOffice.
2.  **Mock Implementation**: Replaced with full, real PPTX to SVG conversion and metadata extraction.
3.  **Complex Dependencies**: Removed Redis/Celery; using FastAPI background tasks.
4.  **Windows Compatibility**: Ensured with relative paths and compatible libraries.
5.  **Visual Fidelity**: Significantly improved with primary LibreOffice conversion.
6.  **Performance**: Optimized LibreOffice usage via batch processing; streamlined internal data flow.
7.  **Configuration**: LibreOffice path is now configurable.
8.  **Robustness**: Added more detailed error handling, timeouts, and fallback mechanisms.

## What's Left To Build
- Further refinements to error handling based on extensive testing (especially LibreOffice SVG mapping).
- Detailed documentation for the new processing flow, configuration, and deployment.
- Consideration for advanced features (e.g., more sophisticated slide background extraction if needed).

## Known Issues
1.  **LibreOffice SVG Mapping**: The reliability of mapping SVGs generated by `impress_svg_Export` (when converting a whole presentation) to specific slide numbers needs thorough testing across different LibreOffice versions/OS, especially if the number of output SVGs doesn't match the slide count.
2.  **Complex Element Rendering (Fallback)**: While LibreOffice handles most elements well, the ElementTree fallback will have limitations with very complex shapes, charts, or SmartArt if not explicitly handled.

## Current Status
The project implements a significantly refactored and optimized hybrid approach for PPTX to SVG conversion. It prioritizes high visual fidelity using LibreOffice (if available and configured) and falls back to a robust ElementTree-based method. Metadata extraction is comprehensive. The system is more configurable, performant, and robust.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. For Cairo Issue
-   Replaced entirely with a hybrid of LibreOffice (primary) and ElementTree (fallback) for SVG generation.

### 2. For PPTX Conversion & Visual Fidelity
-   **Primary**: Batch LibreOffice call (`_generate_svgs_for_all_slides_libreoffice`) for high-fidelity SVGs.
-   **Fallback**: ElementTree-based `create_svg_from_slide` using pre-extracted shape data and slide background.
-   **Metadata**: `python-pptx` (`extract_shapes`) for detailed text, image, and style information.

### 3. For Architecture & Performance
-   Removed Celery/Redis; using FastAPI BackgroundTasks.
-   Optimized LibreOffice calls to a single batch operation per presentation.
-   Streamlined internal data flow to avoid redundant operations (e.g., calling `extract_shapes` once).

## Next Milestones
1.  **Comprehensive Testing**: Validate with a wide range of PPTX files, focusing on output correctness, SVG mapping by LibreOffice, and error handling.
2.  **Performance Benchmarking**: Quantify improvements from the refactoring.
3.  **Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation (README, Memory Bank) to reflect the current architecture and workflow.
4.  **Frontend Integration Check**: Ensure SVG and metadata output aligns with `slidecanvas` needs.
