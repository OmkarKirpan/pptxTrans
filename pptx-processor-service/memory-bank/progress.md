# Progress Tracker

## What Works
- Basic project structure established
- Core dependencies identified and documented
- Architecture patterns defined
- Memory bank initialized for knowledge retention
- UV package manager successfully installed and configured
- All Python dependencies installed (CairoSVG dependency removed)
- FastAPI application structure is properly set up
- API routes are defined (processing, status, health)
- Data models/schemas are well-defined
- Supabase integration code exists
- SVG generation implemented using ElementTree (no Cairo dependency)
- PPTX to SVG conversion works
- Thumbnail generation works
- Text extraction with positioning implemented
- App runs successfully on Windows

## What's In Progress
- Testing with real PPTX files
- Integration with frontend slidecanvas component
- Refinement of SVG generation for better visual fidelity

## What's Been Fixed
1. **Cairo Library Dependency**: Replaced with native SVG generation using ElementTree
2. **Mock Implementation**: Implemented real PPTX to SVG conversion
3. **Complex Dependencies**: Removed Redis/Celery
4. **Windows Compatibility**: Using relative paths and compatible libraries

## What's Left To Build
- Improved text styling extraction
- Better handling of complex slides (tables, charts, images)
- Detailed documentation
- Performance optimizations for large files
- Error handling for edge cases

## Known Issues
1. **Text Styling Limitations**: Basic styling only (font size, weight, etc.)
2. **Complex Element Handling**: Tables, charts, and images may not render perfectly
3. **Text Positioning**: May require fine-tuning for perfect positioning

## Current Status
The project has a good structure and the core functionality (PPTX to SVG conversion) is implemented. The application runs on Windows without dependency issues. Architecture has been simplified by removing Celery/Redis.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. For Cairo Issue
- Implemented direct SVG generation using ElementTree (no Cairo needed)

### 2. For PPTX Conversion
- Using python-pptx to extract text and shapes with positioning
- Generating SVG manually with proper text placement

### 3. For Architecture
- Removed Celery/Redis dependencies
- Using FastAPI's background tasks for async processing
- Simplified to direct processing

## Next Milestones
1. **Test with Real Files**: Ensure it works with actual PPTX files
2. **Optimize for Frontend**: Ensure output format matches slidecanvas requirements
3. **Improve Text Styling**: Better capture and render text styles
4. **Support Complex Elements**: Improve handling of tables, charts, images
5. **Performance Optimization**: For large presentations
