# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Testing the app with real PPTX files
- Further optimizing the SVG generation
- Improving text positioning and styling extraction

## Recent Changes
- Removed CairoSVG dependency to avoid Windows compatibility issues
- Implemented direct SVG generation using ElementTree
- Removed Celery/Redis dependencies for simplified architecture
- Updated configuration to use relative paths for Windows compatibility
- Implemented actual PPTX to SVG conversion
- Fixed text extraction with positioning
- Created proper thumbnail generation
- Updated README with clear instructions

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Cairo Library Dependency (Windows)
- **Issue**: CairoSVG required Cairo library to be installed separately on Windows
- **Solution**: Replaced CairoSVG with direct SVG generation using ElementTree
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 2. Mock Implementation
- **Issue**: The pptx_processor.py had placeholder SVG generation instead of actual conversion
- **Solution**: Implemented real conversion using python-pptx and ElementTree for SVG generation
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 3. Overly Complex Architecture
- **Issue**: Code included Redis/Celery for task queuing but user wants simple working app
- **Solution**: Removed Redis/Celery dependencies and simplified to direct processing
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 4. Windows Compatibility
- **Issue**: Application couldn't run on Windows due to dependency issues
- **Solution**: Used relative paths and Windows-compatible libraries
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Next Steps
1. Test with various PPTX files to ensure robust conversion
2. Improve handling of complex slides (tables, charts, images)
3. Enhance text styling extraction for better fidelity
4. Optimize performance for large presentations
5. Add detailed error handling for edge cases

## Active Decisions

### Package Management
- **Decision**: Use UV instead of pip for package management ✓
- **Status**: Successfully implemented

### SVG Generation Approach
- **Decision**: Use ElementTree for direct SVG generation
- **Rationale**: Avoids Cairo dependency and works on all platforms
- **Status**: Successfully implemented

### Architecture Simplification
- **Decision**: Remove Celery/Redis dependency for basic functionality
- **Rationale**: User wants simple working app without complex infrastructure
- **Implementation**: Using FastAPI's background tasks for async processing
- **Status**: Successfully implemented

### PPTX Processing Approach
- **Decision**: Use python-pptx to extract content and create SVG manually
- **Rationale**: Most direct approach with fewest dependencies
- **Status**: Successfully implemented

## Implementation Details
- Text extraction preserves positioning and basic styling
- SVG generation includes properly positioned text elements
- Thumbnail generation shows text block positioning
- Background tasks handle processing without blocking API responses
- Relative paths ensure cross-platform compatibility

## User Requirements Clarified
- App will take PPTX from frontend or get it from Supabase storage
- Generate SVG per slide with metadata for text display in slidecanvas frontend component
- Used for PPTX text translation
- No security or tests needed - just working functionality

## Current Questions
- Should we use LibreOffice headless for conversion or implement custom solution?
- Is exact visual fidelity required or is text extraction with positioning sufficient?
- What metadata format is expected by the slidecanvas frontend component?
