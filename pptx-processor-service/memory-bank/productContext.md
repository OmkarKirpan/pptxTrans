# Product Context

## Problem Statement
When translating PowerPoint presentations, traditional methods often break the layout or lose visual fidelity. Content positioning, formatting, and slide design are frequently compromised, making the translated presentation look unprofessional and difficult to read.

## Solution
The PPTX Processor Service enables high-quality translation of PowerPoint presentations by:

1. Converting slides to SVG format that preserves all visual elements exactly
2. Extracting text with precise positioning data
3. Enabling text-only translation while maintaining the original slide design
4. Supporting a seamless integration with the PowerPoint Translator App frontend

## How It Works
1. **Input**: User uploads PPTX file or provides Supabase storage reference
2. **Processing**: Service converts each slide to SVG and extracts text metadata
3. **Output**: Returns SVGs and text positioning data to frontend
4. **Frontend**: SlideCanvas component displays SVG with overlaid translatable text
5. **Translation**: User translates text while visual layout remains intact

## User Experience Goals
- Provide a seamless experience for translating PowerPoint presentations
- Maintain perfect visual fidelity in translated slides
- Ensure text positioning and styling remain intact after translation
- Enable fast processing times to minimize user waiting
- Support progress tracking for large presentations

## Target Users
- Content creators needing to translate presentations for international audiences
- Education professionals creating multilingual course materials
- Businesses presenting to global stakeholders
- Government agencies with multilingual communication requirements

## Technical Integration
- **Frontend Component**: SlideCanvas expects SVG + text metadata
- **Data Format**: Structured JSON with text positions, styles, and content
- **Storage**: Optional Supabase integration for asset persistence
- **Processing**: Direct API calls for immediate results

## Current Implementation Gap
- **Expected**: Working PPTX to SVG conversion with text extraction
- **Actual**: Mock implementation that generates placeholder SVGs
- **Impact**: Cannot be used for actual translation workflows yet

## Business Value
- Enables professional-quality presentation translation
- Saves significant time compared to manual translation and reformatting
- Provides consistent quality across all translated slides
- Removes technical barriers to creating multilingual presentations

## Simplified Requirements
Based on user feedback, the focus is on:
- Getting a working implementation quickly
- Avoiding complex infrastructure (no Redis/Celery)
- Windows compatibility for development
- Direct integration with frontend components
- No need for extensive security or testing initially
